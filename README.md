## üë©‚Äçüíª PROJECTS
### EC2 Master
This AWS project aims to create a highly available and scalable web application infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The infrastructure includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets spread across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), EC2 instances hosting an Nginx web server, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), Auto Scaling Group, and CloudWatch alarms for automatic scaling based on CPU utilization.

Application Architecture used:


EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Networking Services:
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Internet Gateway
Route Table
Subnet
NAT Gateway
Security Group
ALB (Application Load Balancer)
Auto Scaling
CloudWatch
Other Technology used:
Terraform
Bash 


Architecture Overview:
The project architecture consists of the following components:

VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is created

Public Subnets: Three public subnets are created, each in a different Availability Zone, allowing instances in these subnets to have public internet access

Private Subnets: Three private subnets are created, each in a different Availability Zone, where EC2 instances hosting the web application reside. These instances do not have direct internet access.

Internet Gateway: An Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC, allowing instances in the public subnets to connect to the internet.

NAT Gateway:A NAT Gateway is deployed in one of the public subnets, enabling instances in the private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while keeping them secure.

Security Groups: Security groups are implemented to control inbound and outbound traffic for the instances.

ALB: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is created in the public subnets to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple instances.

Auto Scaling Group: An Auto Scaling Group is configured to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU utilization. CloudWatch alarms trigger scaling policies.
